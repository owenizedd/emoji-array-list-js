# Emoji List for your projects ‚≠ê

A collection of emoji list in array written in JavaScript  üî•  
I prepared for everyone who wants to display list of emojis, you can use it for anything you want, emoji picker, displaying flags for countries, you name it.  
All emojis can be found on `emoji-list.js` ‚¨ÖÔ∏è

I use this for my chat app project for emoji picker, I want to create my own emoji picker instead of using library, so I found it easy if there's premade emoji list.
